    <p>The  Goal  of  this  project  is  design  an  application  forNational College of Ireland students, 
        who are lookingfor a place to stay with their peers or alumni. When a studenttries to search for a 
        place in Dublin, most of the time they gethit with an exorbitant amount of rental fee by property owners.
        Then  there  are  public  websites  like  daft.ie  and  many  otherwhich provide housing details but donâ€™t 
        cater to the studentsrequirement. So we have designed the web application to helpanyone find an accommodation, 
        who is seeking a place to stayin the heart of Dublin and nearby NCI. We have designed theapplication  to  be  
        easy  to  use  and  simple  enough  to  navigatefind  what  the  student  wants.  Also  this  application  helps  
        theuser  to  find  a  room  mate  who  is  studying  in  NCI  like  analumni or student who is pursuing the degree. 
        This also helpspeople  to  find  a  place  near  by  NCI  before  they  even  arrivein Dublin, this especially helps 
        international students.The webapplication  helps  the  user  to  find  any  vacant  places  hostedby  the  student  
        who  already  has  a  extra  room  to  share  or  anindividual who can post their property for renting.</p>
